        <p>Formerly a technical recruiter, while recruiting for a web developer position I discovered that web development
          offers the opportunity to create something that effects meaningful change and solve complex problems. After spending
          a few months studying and working on a few projects on my own, I decided that this was the career path I wanted
          to take and relocated to Seattle to join one of the most talented tech communities in the world. I enrolled in
          Code Fellows to make sure that I had the best start possible and have since been building upon the strong communication,
          interpersonal and prioritization skills I gained as a recruiter. My ultimate goal is simple, as part of a well-oiled
          team I want to build web applications that make our usersâ€™ lives easier. </p>

        <p>I am a software developer, I am very fortunate to have spent time travelling and living all around the world,
          giving me a much more different experience than most people. Right now I just got out of my first year at Montana State
          University studying computer science. Going to University wasn't what I was used to, taking a traditional path
          of education was the exact opposite of what my life growing up was like. So I decided to take this path, growing
          as a software developer, creating projects and products that can make someones life easier, Building them from
          the ground up is what I love doing and I hope I never stop.

        <p>Formerly a salesman working for the insurance industry, I was encouraged to learn programming by my brother-in-law.
          At first I found coding to be scary and a bit daunting, then I realized that coding can be quiet enjoyable. Convinced
          by my brother-in-law's work life balance and his fulfillment from his career, I made the leap of faith and quit
          my career. I eventually developed a passion for coding and find messing around with different logic strings to
          be amusing. My goal is to continue to grow my passion for coding and eventually develop my own application so I
          can showcase my creativity.</p>
