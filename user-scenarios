USER SCENARIOS

* A couple is living together and they keep forgetting or duplicating tasks, such as feeding the dog, because they are not always around to see what tasks their partner is doing.
* A bunch of roommates are trying to coordinate tasks. Some of those roommates have different ideas of what needs to be done and how often. This tool will create a uniform and organized list of agreed upon tasks.
* A group of people living together donâ€™t want to have to remind each other to complete tasks. They want an automatic system to do it to reduce friction in the group.
