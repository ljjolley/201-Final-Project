# 201-Final-Project

* Project Name: Happy Household
* Team Members: Timothy Li, LJ Jolley, Evan Slaton, Jack Teasell

* Problem Domain and Solution: Managing tasks with minimal tension in a household is difficult and often a source of conflict. This webapp is designed to set clear expectations about what tasks need to be completed and whose turn it is to complete that task.
* Version: Happy Home version 1.0.0
* Libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function. If needed, provide instructions that the user may need to follow in order to get your application up and running on their own computer. TBD
